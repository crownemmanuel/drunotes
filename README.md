Drunotes
================

This is a simple proof of concept notepad application built using drupal to demonstrate the use of drupal in building desktop applications inside Electron.
its built using a fork of https://github.com/garak/electron-symfony.
The goal was to achieve this with very minimal customization to the default drupal. a realworld would application would have much more customization
and would probably work best with a javascript framework such as react (see https://www.drupal.org/project/react) sitting in the frontend.
